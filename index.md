### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was an enjoyable lab because I find the game of Blackjack to be simple, 
    but enjoyable. What I learned from this lab is how to incorporate a function that changes 
    depending on the situation, in this case the ace card being valued as either 1 or 11.

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8, part 1 was an enjoyable lab because the end result is a pleasant pattern which 
    I found more satisfying when I finally got it to work. What I learned from this lab 
    is how to incorporate embedded loops into a program.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was an enjoyable lab because it was an interesting new concept in programming 
    that I hadn't done before. What I learned from this lab is how to make use of a separate 
    text file in a program and using the contents of the file.
